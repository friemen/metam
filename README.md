# metam

A meta modeling facility for textual model representation with Clojure.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/friemen/metam.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/friemen/metam)

## Usage

Include in your project.clj the following dependency

    [metam/core "1.0.2"]


See the wsdl [metamodel](samples/src/samples/wsdl/metamodel.clj)
and [model](samples/src/samples/wsdl/model.clj) namespaces.

To get a human readable representation of an instantiated model m
use `(pr-model m)` in the REPL.


## Motivation by examples

If you want to describe the structure of UI forms, entities,
service interfaces, state machines or other typical elements
of an enterprise application in a DSL like manner, you could
do that easily by just using regular Clojure maps.

Those maps would form an in-memory **model**.

In fact I started creating models in Clojure by introducing 
map-creating factory functions that I used in a nested fashion 
to provide the look as shown below:

Here's the Clojure textual representation of a **UI panel** model:

```clojure
(def p (panel "sample" :lygeneral "flowy, fill" :components [
     (panel "details" :lygeneral "ins 0, wrap 2" :components [
        (dropdownlist "salutation" :initial-items salutations :formatter #(str % "..."))
        (textfield "firstname")
        (textfield "lastname" :required true)
        (textfield "birthday" :format date)
        (textfield "age" :format number :required true)
        (textfield "height" :format number2)
        (checkbox "male")
        (radiogroup "gender" :buttons [ :male :female (radiobutton "other" :text "OTHER") ])
      ])
      (table "addresses" :lyhint "span, grow" :columns [
        (column "firstname" :title "First name" :editable true)
        (column "lastname" :getter-fn #(:lastname %) :editable true)
        (column "street" :getter-fn #(:street %) :setter-fn #(assoc % :street %2))
      ])
      (panel "actions" :lygeneral "ins 0" :lyhint "right, span" :components [
        (button "delete" :action-fn delete)                                                                    
        (button "ok" :action-fn ok)
        (button "cancel")
      ])
   ])
)
```

And a Clojure representation of a **service interface** would be something like this:

```clojure
(def string (simpletype "string"))
(def date (simpletype "date"))

(def address
     (complextype "Address" :elements
                  [(one "street" string)
                   (one "zipcode" string)
                   (one "city" string)]))

(def person
     (complextype "Person" :elements
                  [(one "firstname" string)
                   (one "lastname" string)
                   (one "birthday" date)
                   (many "addresses" address)]))

(def s
     (service "Bar" :operations
              [(op "callMe1"
                   :in-elements [(one "a" address)
                                 (one "t" string)]
                   :out-elements [(one "s" string)])
               (op "callMe2"
                   :in-elements [(one "p" person)])]))
```

To prevent me from creating useless models, a little bit of validation 
as part of these factory functions would be nice.
And yes, it would be handy if model elements would be complemented
with default values to use convention-over-configuration and make
textual models less noisy.

If you'd build more than one of those simple DSLs yourself then you'll see
a lot of repetition (factory functions, validation, defaults provision).
**metam** simply factors these common things into a library with a
defmetamodel macro. So the meta model for the service interface as shown
above would look like this:

```clojure
(defmetamodel wsdl
  (-> (make-hierarchy)
      (derive ::complextype ::datatype)
      (derive ::simpletype ::datatype))
  
  {; a data structure
   ::complextype  {:elements [(type-of? ::e)]}
   
   ; a primitive type (like string, number, date)
   ::simpletype   {}
   
   ; an element of a complextype
   ::e            {:type [required (type-of? ::datatype)]
                   :mult [(value-of? :one :many)]}

   ; a web service                         
   ::service      {:operations [(type-of? ::op)]}
   
   ; a service operation
   ::op           {:in-elements [(type-of? ::e)]
                   :out-elements [(type-of? ::e)]}
   }
  #'no-defaults)


;; Define shortcut functions

(defn one [name type]
  (e name :type type :mult :one))

(defn many [name type]
  (e name :type type :mult :many))
```
  
The **defmetamodel** creates a factory function for every meta type
(like ::complextype, ::e or ::service). The functions specified in the
vectors following the attribute keywords are predicates that are used
for validation.
Each factory function validates input and provides default values (if
a corresponding function var was given).

For an invocation of defmetamodel macroexpand-1 outputs:

```clojure
(do (def wsdl-hierarchy
      (-> (make-hierarchy)
          (derive :wsdl/complextype :wsdl/datatype)
          (derive :wsdl/simpletype :wsdl/datatype)))
    (def wsdl
      {:hierarchy wsdl-hierarchy,
       :types
       {:wsdl/complextype
        {:elements [(type-of? :wsdl/e)]},
        :wsdl/simpletype
        {},
        :wsdl/e
        {:type [required (type-of? :wsdl/datatype)],
         :mult [(value-of? :one :many)]},
        :wsdl/service
        {:operations [(type-of? :wsdl/op)]},
        :wsdl/op
        {:in-elements [(type-of? :wsdl/e)],
         :out-elements [(type-of? :wsdl/e)]}},
       :default-fn-var #'no-defaults})
    (def complextype (wsdl/instance-factory wsdl :wsdl/complextype))
    (def simpletype (wsdl/instance-factory wsdl :wsdl/simpletype))
    (def e (wsdl/instance-factory wsdl :wsdl/e))
    (def service (wsdl/instance-factory wsdl :wsdl/service))
    (def op (wsdl/instance-factory wsdl :wsdl/op)))
```
